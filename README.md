Estimation of the likelihood that an offender is arrested for a crime incident on police records from
the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS), accounting for unreported
crimes. Estimates of the likelihood of police notification are obtained using
data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).

Get started with data processing by reading the docs in the `process-data` directory. Then run the analysis using the files in `analysis`.
